## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

#### New Tables Added:
```sql
-- Settled tickets tracking
CREATE TABLE settled_tickets (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  ticket_number VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  order_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  total_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  payment_method VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  settled_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  thermal_receipt_data JSONB,
  receipt_printed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  print_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  cashier_id INTEGER,
  table_number INTEGER,
  order_type VARCHAR(20),
  customer_count INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  notes TEXT
);
```

#### Database Functions:
- `generate_ticket_number()` - Creates sequential ticket numbers
- `settle_ticket()` - Processes ticket settlement with thermal data
- `get_settled_tickets_report()` - Retrieves filtered settled tickets
- `increment_print_count()` - Updates reprint statistics

### Services Architecture
